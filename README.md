# Introduction

### What is Botful?

Botful is a framework designed to make programming robots for the First Robotics Competition as easy as possible. It combines wrappers for WPILib, Pheonix motor controllers, and Spark motor controllers. The framework is written in Kotlin, a language meant to supplement and enhance Java. 

### Why Kotlin?

Botful uses Kotlin simply because Kotlin is more feature-rich than Java. While Java has gotten better over the years, it still has problems like poor null safety and being very verbose. Kotlin's syntax is easier on the eyes and allows you to do more while write less code. Need to learn Kotlin?

### Why Botful?

#### Minimizes mistakes

Botful is a framework for beginners and experienced coders alike, so it is designed to prevent as many mistakes as possible. It requires you to specify units so you never mix up meters and feet. It has network tables integration that allows for safe property access and reactive updating. Its clever take on subsystems prevents any subsystem from running two tasks at once. Botful is dedicated to preventing your robot from running into a wall.

#### Cuts down on boilerplate code

Botful is straight to the point and doesn't require any excess setup. By utilizing Kotlin's syntax, DSL builders, callbacks, and coroutines, Botful allows you to focus less on boilerplate and more on coding your robot.
